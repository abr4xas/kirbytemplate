Text: Bury all your secrets in my skin come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins the air around me still feels like a cage and love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again...

So if you love me, let me go. And run away before I know. My heart is just too dark to care. I can't destroy what isn't there. Deliver me into my Fate - If I'm alone I cannot hate i don't deserve to have you... My smile was taken long ago / If I can change I hope I never know

I still press your letters to my lips and cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light but all of that was ripped apart... when you refused to fight

So save your breath, I will not hear. I think I made it very clear. You couldn't hate enough to love. Is that supposed to be enough? I only wish you weren't my friend. Then I could hurt you in the end. I never claimed to be a Saint... 
My own was banished long ago / It took the Death of Hope to let you go so Break Yourself Against My Stones
And Spit Your Pity In My Soul You Never Needed Any Help You Sold Me Out To Save Yourself And I Won't Listen To Your Shame You Ran Away - You're All The Same Angels Lie To Keep Control... My Love Was Punished Long Ago
If You Still Care, Don't Ever Let Me Know If you still care, don't ever let me know...
